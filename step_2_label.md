## Second step: labelling

### Labelling
In this step we will learn about importance of data quality and labelling process.

Important points :
- Data and quality is the key for generating good ML algorithm
- If data and response are correct at 80% rate, your ML model cannot perform better than 80%
- Labelling instructions are build with the entire team and must resolve, add new sample of edge cases when you encounter an example
- Data label cost a lot, if you can accelerate labelling with automatic pre-labelling phase, do it.
- Feeback loop is a good way to have pre-label set up

### Data drift

You will encounter a lot of kind of drift.
Monitoring data drift is mandatory to go to production.
